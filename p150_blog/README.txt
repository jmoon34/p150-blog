Based on Corey Schafer's tutorial: https://coreyms.com/development/python/python-django-tutorials-full-series

Customized for my rowing team back in University, along with additions following django documentation.  Incomplete project due to lack of mastery over web development concepts.  Will be resumed some time in the future.

Functionalities:
1. Add commenting functionality
2. Calendar for day to day practice schedules and activities (expandable for detailed scheduling?)
3. Add private rowing scores in profile (height/weight/1min/max watt/2k/6k/HOP) only accessible by coach
4. Archive for indoor/outdoor workouts, with different templates


Completed:
1. Commenting
2. Uploading media files and embedding links


Things to work on:
1. Can updating/deleting comments be done on the post_detail page?
2. Image scaling issue with ckeditor when window is small
